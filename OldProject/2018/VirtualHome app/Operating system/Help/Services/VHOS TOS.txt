VHOS TOS

Terrms of service

1 Private networks

you are allowed to emulate your house on private networks in any way you want. You can do house tours through this, but if the structure does NOT accurately represent your house, you cannot change it to a public server until it is fixed
You cannot convert inappropriate structures to public dreamscape zones. You must either fix the inappropriate parts or convert to private dreamscape

2 Public servers

Public servers are displayed to everyone in the world. 
Privacy warnings:
Users can go into your virtualized structure, and view your address through the Virtual Network World Navigator program. If you want to remain anonymous AND have a public structure, go to the dreamscape mode. 

3 Copyright 

You can only use copyrighted content that you are permitted to use, and content that the owner approves you of using. Copyright owners cannot change their minds afterwards under any circumstances to prevent unfair takedowns
You can use as much copyrighted content was you want in private networks, but you can get an IP-Ban if you get over 10 strikes in public mode

4 Dreamscape

In private dreamscape, you can create anything that you want, with no rules
However, in public dreamscape, the same rules as a public server apply, except for the rules where it must be exactly like it is in real life
Dreamscape has a maximum perimeter of 2,500,000,000 by 2,500,000,000 feet (1 foot = 12 megapixels)

5 Privacy

Only YOU and the people you invited can view your private networks
In public networks, since it is just a virtualized version of your structure that you made, no info is given except your address
you can create ads on your own business

6 Usernames

Your username varies on which server you go to
on Family servers that are rated F.S.7
you cannot say any curse words, or have any offensive words in your username
on servers that are rated P.S.12
the server owners can limit curse words, but if they choose not to, you can say slightly offensive stuff that 12 year olds know about, or have a slightly offensive username, but not a severe one
on servers that are rated V.L.0x
the server owners allow all profanity
keep in mind, it can get nasty, and reports don't work here UNLESS you are getting harassed

7 Copyright

we have to be careful with copyright. After every 3 warnings, there will be a copyright strike. Get 10 copyright strikes, and your account will be IP-Banned
once your account is IP-Banned, your virtualizations will still be there, but you will be unable to access them, All copyrighted content on your virtualizations will be removed
if you think your ban was unfair, you can contact us
if it goes successful, you get all your progress back, and gain an additional copyright strike slot (so it takes another 3 warnings to get banned) and your strikes will reset
each strike expires after 3 months, however they don't all expire at once (unless you received them all on the same day)
IP-Bans are permanent, you will no longer be able to access any public servers, but you will still have access to private ones

8 Spam

Spamming is NOT allowed. There is a cooldown of 5 messages per minute to prevent spam (because no-one wants to read all of that so fast)
if you exploit the spam system (examples: bots, alternate accounts) your account (with all your bots) will be IP-Banned

9 Misleading content

Making misleading content is untolerated. Misleading content will result in warnings. The warning system acts the same as the copyright strike system, 3 warnings = 1 strike 10 strikes = IP-Ban IP-Ban resolved + 1 strike slot 3 warnings = 1 strike 11 strikes = Second IP-Ban ETC
Misleading content is tried and taken down through user reports

10 Nudity

Nudity is not allowed in most servers (nudity is never allowed on servers that are designed for people 17 and below) however, museum servers are allowed to, as it is qualified as art, to a certain extent, and cannot go as far as sexual intercourse (below that, it is fine as musueam adult content only)

11 Exploits + bots

Exploiting the system is a major offense. You only get 3 warnings with bots (no strikes) as soon as you get the third warning, you will receive an IP-Ban
it is more difficult to resolve this type of ban than a copyright ban, but you MUST contact us if you belief there was a mistake.
If evidence goes through, and you are proven "not guilty" your account will be restored, and you will be free of all warnings (including all copyright strikes + copyright warnings)
Repeated Malicious attacks will result in a police call, and a fine of up to $10000

12 Unhelpful/unfair reports

Our report system is heavily monitored. To keep up with the reports, we will ONLY allow 3 reports per day. If you exploit the system to get a 4th report, it will be similar to a explot ban, which is harder to get than a copyright ban
All reports are read within 72 hours, and if needed, the server will go into maintenance to investigate and fix issues with your reports
unfair reports will result in a warning
after 2 warnings, you will get your account suspended for 7 days, instead of a 3rd strike
if you believe this was unfair, you can talk to us, and try to resolve it
if resolved, your account will be unsuspended, and all your strikes will be cleared
